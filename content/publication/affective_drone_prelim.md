abstract = "Drone swarms are teams of autonomous un-manned aerial vehicles that act as a collective entity. We are interested in humanizing drone swarms, equipping them with the ability to emotionally affect human users through their non-verbal motions. Inspired by recent findings in how observers are emotionally touched by watching dance moves, we investigate the questions of whether and how coordinated drone swarms' motions can achieve emotive impacts on general audience. Our preliminary study on Amazon Mechanical Turk led to a number of interesting findings, including both promising results and challenges."
abstract_short = "How do people feel when watching drone swarms moving? Our MTurk preliminary study shows that coordination and unexpectedness in motions are salient cues perceived by observers."
