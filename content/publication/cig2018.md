abstract = "Deck building is a crucial component in playing Collectible Card Games (CCGs). The goal of deck building is to choose a fixed-sized subset of cards from a large card pool, so that they work well together in-game against specific opponents. Existing methods either lack flexibility to adapt to different opponents or require large computational resources, still making them unsuitable for any real-time or large-scale application. We propose a new deck recommendation system, named Q-DeckRec, which learns a deck search policy during a training phase and uses it to solve deck building problem instances. Our experimental results demonstrate Q-DeckRec requires less computational resources to build winning-effective decks after a training phase compared to several baseline methods."
abstract_short = "Deck recommendation is formulated as a sequential decision making process (Markov Decision Process), the Q-function of which is estimated from data using Multi-Layer Perceptron."
