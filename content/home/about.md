# Biography

Truong-Huy D. Nguyen is an assistant professor of computer science at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20344/computer_and_information_science), [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/). He is endeavoring to understand human behaviors and decision making, and build experimental and practical applications leveraging such insights. His research therefore lies at the cross-junction of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and behavior analytics, with favorite applications being games and robotics.  He is actively collaborating with the [GUII Lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/guii/) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/) (Boston, MA), and the [Robotics & Computer Vision Laboratory](http://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~lyons/rcvlab) at [Fordham](http://www.fordham.edu/).
